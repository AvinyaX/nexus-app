# Hardware Store Management System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

We have successfully implemented **Phase 2** of the comprehensive Hardware Store Management System, building upon the existing IAM (Identity and Access Management) foundation. This system provides a robust, multi-company architecture with complete data isolation and role-based access control.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Multi-Company Architecture ✨
- **Hybrid Approach**: Shared database with tenant isolation via `company_id` foreign key
- **Companies Table**: UUID primary keys, settings (JSONB), subscription plans, active status
- **User-Company Relationships**: Many-to-many with role assignments and default company selection
- **Complete Data Isolation**: All business entities scoped to company context

### 2. Database Schema 📊
- **Core IAM Models**: Users, Roles, Permissions, UserRoles, RolePermissions, UserPermissions
- **Multi-Company Models**: Companies, UserCompanies
- **Hardware Store Entities**: 
  - Products & Categories
  - Inventory Management
  - Customers & Agents
  - Quotations & Invoices
  - Orders & Deliveries
  - Returns & Communications
  - Payments & Commissions

### 3. Backend API (NestJS) 🚀
- **Company Context Service**: Automatic company filtering and access validation
- **Products API**: Complete CRUD with company isolation
- **Companies API**: Multi-company management
- **Security Guards**: JWT authentication + Company access validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with proper HTTP status codes

### 4. Frontend Interface (React Router) 🎨
- **Modern UI**: TailwindCSS with responsive design
- **Company Management**: View companies, user assignments, subscription plans
- **Product Catalog**: Product listing with inventory status, pricing, categories
- **Inventory Tracking**: Stock levels, locations, reorder alerts (demo interface)
- **Customer Management**: Customer profiles, purchase history, agent relationships
- **Role-Based Navigation**: Contextual interfaces based on user permissions

### 5. Sample Data 📈
- **Companies**: ABC Hardware Store, XYZ Building Materials
- **Users**: Admin, Sales, Inventory roles with appropriate permissions
- **Products**: LED Bulbs, Hammers with proper categorization and inventory
- **Permissions**: Granular RBAC for all hardware store modules
